Launch of OMiCount: Innovating Molecular Diagnostics and Genomic Characterization 
We are thrilled to announce the launch of OMiCount, an innovative bioinformatics tool developed by Idrissa Dieng, a scientist at the Institut Pasteur de Dakar. OMiCount is designed to improve laboratory work, maximize precision and save time. To strengthen its wide use, In collaboration with Mamadou Cisse of the Digitalization and Information System Department (DDSI), the tool will soon be available to the general public via a web portal. 
The Oligonucleotides Mismatches Counter (OMiCount) is a transformative bioinformatics tool that evaluates the performance of primer sets against a diverse array of virus variants. This innovation significantly enhances molecular diagnostics and genomic characterization, making substantial contributions to virology, public health, and genomic surveillance. OMiCount has also contributed to the discovery of a key element in the diagnosis of the chikungunya virus. The discovery was published online last week [CDC Trioplex diagnostic assay underperforms in detection of circulating Chikungunya West African genotype](https://journals.asm.org/doi/epub/10.1128/jcm.00405-24)
 
Key Impacts of OMiCount:  
1.     Improved Molecular Diagnostics: Primer Validation, Rapid Adaptation, Efficiency and Degenerate Primer Design.  
2.     Enhanced Genomic Characterization: Comprehensive Analysis, Visual Representation and Optimized Primers 
3.     Supporting Genomic Surveillance: Real-Time Monitoring, Accurate Detection and Adaptability.  
4.     Facilitating Public Health Responses: Timely Identification, Resource Optimization and Enhanced Testing Capabilities. 
5.     Global Health Impact: Preparedness and Response, Collaborative Efforts and Innovation in Diagnostics. 
 
In summary, OMiCount significantly enhances molecular diagnostics and genomic characterization by providing a simple, reliable, efficient, and comprehensive method for oligonucleotide performance evaluation. Its ability to adapt to viral evolution, generate degenerate primers, and offer clear visualizations of primer performance makes it an indispensable tool in the ongoing efforts to combat viral diseases and the mitigation of their impact in public health.
