Genomic monitoring of circulating strains in keys for public health. Herein we present a nextstain build of Senegalese CHIKV strains with contemporary isolates sampled in late 2023 in a global context. The build is accessible through [CHIK_SN][nextstrain]. Genomic is key to decipher viral epidemiology.
